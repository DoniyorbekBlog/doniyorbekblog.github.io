    <pre>
       What is `Counter`?

`Counter` is a **built-in Python class** (standard library) designed to:

> **Count how many times each element appears in an iterable**

An *iterable* can be:

* a list
* a string
* a tuple
* any sequence

---

## 🔍 Your Example Explained Line by Line

### 1️⃣ Create a Counter

```python
c = Counter(["a", "b", "c", "a", "a"])
```

This list contains:

```
a → 3 times
b → 1 time
c → 1 time
```

Internally, `Counter` creates a dictionary-like object:

```python
{
    "a": 3,
    "b": 1,
    "c": 1
}
```

---

### 2️⃣ Accessing counts

```python
c["a"]
```

Returns:

```
3
```

Because `"a"` appears 3 times.

---

```python
c["b"]
```

Returns:

```
1
```

---

### 3️⃣ Why does `c["d"]` return **0**?

```python
c["d"]
```

Returns:

```
0
```

This is **special behavior** of `Counter`.

#### Normal dictionary:

```python
d = {"a": 1}
d["d"]  # ❌ KeyError
```

#### Counter:

```python
c["d"]  # ✅ 0
```

👉 `Counter` assumes:

> “If an element is missing, its count is 0.”

This makes counting logic **clean and safe**.

---

## 🧪 Counter with Strings (VERY COMMON)

```python
Counter("banana")
```

Result:

```python
{
    'b': 1,
    'a': 3,
    'n': 2
}
```

So:

```python
c = Counter("banana")
c["a"]  # 3
```

---

## 🧠 Why `Counter` is BETTER than manual counting

### ❌ Manual way:

```python
counts = {}
for item in items:
    counts[item] = counts.get(item, 0) + 1
```

### ✅ Counter way:

```python
Counter(items)
```

Shorter, clearer, safer.

---

## 🔧 Useful `Counter` Features (Important)

### Most common elements

```python
c.most_common(2)
```

Returns:

```python
[('a', 3), ('b', 1)]
```

---

### Total count

```python
sum(c.values())
```

---

### Convert back to dict

```python
dict(c)
```

---

## ⚠️ Common Beginner Mistake

```python
Counter(["apple", "banana", "apple"])
```

Counts **entire strings**, not letters.

If you want letters:

```python
Counter("apple")
```

---

## 🧠 When You SHOULD Use `Counter`

✔ Counting votes
✔ Letter frequency
✔ Word frequency
✔ Logs & analytics
✔ API response analysis

---

## 🏆 Summary (Memorize This)

* `Counter` counts elements automatically
* Missing keys return `0`
* Works with lists and strings
* Cleaner than manual loops
* Part of Python standard library

---

## 📌 One-line explanation (exam/interview)

> “`collections.Counter` is a specialized dictionary for counting hashable objects that returns zero for missing keys.”

If you want, I can:

* Show **real API data examples**
* Compare `Counter` vs `defaultdict`
* Show common pitfalls
