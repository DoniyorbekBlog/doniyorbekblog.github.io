    <h2>Kata: Converting Strings to JadenCase</h2>
</header>

<section class="description">
    <h3>Description of the Problem</h3>
    <p>
        Jaden Smith, the son of actor Will Smith, is widely recognized not only for his film roles 
        in movies like <em>The Karate Kid</em> (2010) and <em>After Earth</em> (2013), but also for his 
        unusual style of writing on social media. One of the most distinctive traits in his Tweets 
        is that he capitalizes Every Single Word, regardless of grammatical rules.
    </p>

    <p>
        The goal of this kata is to transform any given string into the same style. This format is 
        commonly referred to as <strong>JadenCase</strong>. Every word must begin with an uppercase 
        letter while the rest remains lowercase. Contractions such as <code>aren't</code> must remain intact 
        while still having the first letter capitalized (<code>Aren't</code>).
    </p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <pre>
Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
Jaden-Cased:     "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"
    </pre>

    <h3>My Solution</h3>
    <pre>
def to_jaden_case(string):
    return " ".join([word.capitalize() for word in string.split()])
    </pre>

    <h3>Best Solution</h3>
    <pre>
def to_jaden_case(string):
    return string.title()
    </pre>

    <h3>Detailed Explanation and Comparison</h3>
    <p>
        Both solutions correctly convert sentences into JadenCase, but they differ in how they handle 
        capitalization and how they operate under the hood. Your solution uses a more explicit and 
        deliberate approach: it splits the string into words manually, capitalizes each word 
        individually using <code>capitalize()</code>, and then reconstructs the sentence with <code>join()</code>. 
        This is a clean and very readable method because the transformation is performed step by step.
    </p>

    <p>
        The best solution takes advantage of Python's built-in <code>title()</code> method, which was designed 
        to convert strings so that every word begins with an uppercase letter and the remainder becomes 
        lowercase automatically. This produces the same result in a shorter and more concise form.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, it’s worth noting a subtle detail: <code>title()</code> can behave differently with special cases, 
        such as words containing apostrophes. For standard English contractions like “aren’t,” both 
        solutions behave identically, but in more complex strings, <code>title()</code> may split words in ways 
        you do not expect. Despite that, for this kata and ordinary sentences, the <code>title()</code> 
        implementation is perfectly suitable and highly efficient.
    </p>

    <p>
        Overall, your solution is explicit, transparent, and instructional, while the best solution 
        is minimalistic, built-in, and optimized. Both pass the kata, but <code>title()</code> is often preferred 
        for its simplicity and speed.
