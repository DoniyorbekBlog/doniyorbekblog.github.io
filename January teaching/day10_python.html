        <h2>Problem 1: Square Every Digit</h2>
        <p class="statement">
Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1. (81-1-1-81)

Example #2: An input of 765 will/should return 493625 because 72 is 49, 62 is 36, and 52 is 25. (49-36-25)

Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer.

Happy Coding!        </p>

        <h3>My Solution</h3>
        <pre><code>
def square_digits(num):
    string = ''
    for number in str(num):
        string += str(int(number)**2)
    return string
        </code></pre>

        <h3>Best Solution</h3>
        <pre><code>
def square_digits(num):
    return int("".join([str(int(number)**2) for number in str(num)]))
        </code></pre>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>My solution is clear and readable but builds the string step-by-step.</li>
            <li>The best solution uses a list comprehension and <code>join()</code>, which is more Pythonic and faster.</li>
            <li>It also returns an integer as the problem requires.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Problem 2: Find the Odd-Occurring Integer</h2>
        <p class="statement">
Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

Examples
[7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).
[1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).        </p>

        <h3>My Solution</h3>
        <pre><code>
def find_it(seq):
    for number in seq:
        if seq.count(number)%2==1:
            return number
        </code></pre>

        <h3>Best Solution</h3>
        <pre><code>
def find_it(seq):
    return [x for x in seq if seq.count(x) % 2][0]
        </code></pre>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>My version loops until it finds the number with odd count.</li>
            <li>The best solution uses list comprehension and returns the first match.</li>
            <li>Both work, but the list comprehension is more compact and idiomatic.</li>
        </ul>
