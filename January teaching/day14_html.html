    <h3>What Are HTML Bookmarks?</h3>
    <p>
        Bookmarks in HTML allow you to jump to specific parts of a web page instantly. 
        This is especially helpful when working with long pages, articles, documentation, 
        or multi-section tutorials. A bookmark consists of two parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>A target</strong> – created using the <code>id</code> attribute</li>
        <li><strong>A link</strong> – created using <code>&lt;a href="#ID"&gt;</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When the link is clicked, the browser automatically scrolls to the section that 
        contains the matching <code>id</code> value. This creates a smooth navigation 
        experience without reloading the page.
    </p>

    <h3>Basic Example</h3>
    <p>Bookmark Target:</p>

    <pre>
<h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>
    </pre>

    <p>Link To Bookmark:</p>

    <pre>
<a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>
    </pre>

    <p>Link to a Bookmark on Another Page:</p>

    <pre>
<a href="html_demo.html#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>
    </pre>

    <p>Try clicking the bookmark links below:</p>

    <ul class="nav-list">
        <li><a href="#chapter1">Go to Chapter 1</a></li>
        <li><a href="#chapter2">Go to Chapter 2</a></li>
        <li><a href="#chapter3">Go to Chapter 3</a></li>
        <li><a href="#chapter4">Go to Chapter 4</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>This chapter introduces the purpose and structure of HTML bookmarks.</p>

    <h2 id="chapter2">Chapter 2 – Why Bookmarks Are Useful</h2>
    <p>
        Bookmarks improve navigation, create a better user experience, 
        and allow instant access to key information inside a single page.
    </p>

    <h2 id="chapter3">Chapter 3 – How Bookmarks Work</h2>
    <p>
        When a user clicks a link with <code>href="#target"</code>, 
        the browser searches the page for an element with the matching <code>id</code>. 
        If it finds one, the page scrolls directly to that element.
    </p>

    <h2 id="chapter4">Chapter 4 – Full Example</h2>
    <p>
        Below is a simple structure demonstrating a complete bookmark navigation system that 
        could be used in long tutorials, documentation, essays, or wikis.

    <h3>Deep and Detailed Explanation</h3>
    <p>
        HTML bookmarks are one of the most fundamental yet powerful navigation features available 
        on web pages. They allow the user to jump instantly to specific content areas without 
        leaving the page. This is especially helpful when dealing with long documents such as 
        textbooks, research articles, manuals, or multi-part programming lessons.
    </p>

    <p>
        The key idea behind a bookmark is the <strong>id attribute</strong>. 
        Every HTML element can have an ID, and that ID must be unique within the page. 
        IDs act as “anchors” or “named positions” inside the page. 
        Whenever a link references <code>#idname</code>, the browser automatically scrolls to 
        that element. This creates a smooth experience that feels like internal navigation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another important detail is that bookmark links do not reload the page. 
        They simply reposition the user inside the same document. 
        This improves performance and makes pages more interactive. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Bookmarks can also work across multiple pages. If you include a file name before the 
        <code>#id</code>, the browser first loads the page and then jumps to the bookmark section. 
        This is extremely common in documentation sites where each chapter is a separate file but 
        users still want to deep-link to a specific section.
    </p>

    <p>
        Overall, bookmarks are essential for creating professional, organized websites 
        with smooth, intuitive navigation. Every developer should understand them.
